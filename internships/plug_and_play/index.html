    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><h1 id="why-plug-and-play">Why Plug and Play</h1>
<p>I got the opportunity to work at Plug and Play in Singapore due to the generosity of my friend Matt, who I met while studying at the Chinese Language Institute in Guilin. Back in 2017, we had been some of the only 外国人 (foreigners) in Guilin, and so despite him being a few years older than me, we had enjoyed exploring the town and the bars of Guilin together. After leaving Guilin, I returned to start my bachelor&rsquo;s at Warwick, while Matt started working for Plug and Play in Singapore.</p>
<p>The great thing about Matt was that he was always willing to give me advice and act as a mentor: he had been through university and made his way in the corporate world; I was about to start and needed all the advice I could get. We kept in touch after leaving Guilin, reminiscing on the times in Guilin and discussing future plans. As summer approached, I realised that internship experience at Plug and Play, an innovative company at the interface between technology and investment, would help me figure out what kind of future career I wanted, and stand me in good stead for the future. I floated the idea of interning at Plug and Play, and Matt kindly forwarded my CV to the manager and put in a good word for me. Luckily the manager was in a good mood and gave me a shot. I was going to be interning at Plug and Play in Singapore!</p>
<p>My internship would be 6 weeks, starting in late August. This would not leave me with much time to relax at the end of summer, but it freed up 10 weeks for my brother and I to travel in Australia from June to August. The internship in Singapore would &lsquo;break up&rsquo; the journey back from Oz.</p>
<h1 id="my-time-in-singapore">My time in Singapore</h1>
<p>Arrival in Singapore from Sydney was a relaxed affair for me. Not so much for my brother Peter, who needed to catch a connecting flight back to London. Peter and I had taken a fair few flights that summer, and the airlines seemed be making a habit of delaying our first connecting flight, and ensuring that the second one left bang on time. Suddenly a 2 hour layover was cut down to a 10 minute layover, and Peter was forced to blaze a trail across the airport to make his flight, with barely time to wave goodbye.</p>
<p>As he was boarding his flight, I sauntered out of the airport and took a taxi to the Airbnb I had rented to cover my time in Singapore. It was the middle of the night, but still hot and humid, as I lugged my bags up the dingy stairs into my room. I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that I had chosen to live in one of the cheapest rooms in Singapore: a rickety thin bed, a wardrobe that fell apart every time it was opened, and a windowless room. It wasn&rsquo;t the most pleasant place. I had chosen it in order to lessen the burden on my parents, who would be footing the bill. You see I had only been able to secure an unpaid internship, and so the whole time there was coming out of my (parents') pocket. Fair enough. The firm didn&rsquo;t usually take interns as young as me, and there wasn&rsquo;t much value a 19 year old could bring to the office in 6 weeks. The hope was that I would be reimbursed with a fun and useful experience.</p>
<p>After I had put all the bags down on the floor, I collapsed onto the bed, and slept&hellip;</p>
<p>The next morning I explored the local area a little, and bought some basic items that I would need while I was there. It was still a couple of days before I would start, so I had a look around some of Singapore, and made sure I knew how to make the commute to Centennial Tower, where I would be working.</p>
<p>The next day I met up with Matt and he showed me around the office before joining me for a pint to catch up.</p>
<p>For the remainder of my time in Singapore, I settled into a routine of working 9 to 5 at the office, and spending the evenings working out and chatting to friends from back home.
On weekends I would be free to explore the touristy sites and restaurants of the city, and hang out with Matt sometimes too.</p>
<p>Writing this two years after the event, there are still a few notable memories.</p>

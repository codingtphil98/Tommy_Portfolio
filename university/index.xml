      <description>During my final year of school, I found it difficult to choose what I wanted to study at university. Therefore I decided to take a year out to give myself time and life experience before making my choice. Having decided to take a year out, I now had to decide what to do with it.
I wanted to do something that I would never be able to do at any other point in my life.</description>
